## Architecture Overview

### Layer 1: Entry Point
- `cmd/janus/main.go` - Bootstrap application
- Injects version information (version, commit, date)
- Delegates to internal command handler

### Layer 2: Command Handler
- `internal/cmd/` - Command definitions and handlers
- Root command with persistent flags
- Configuration initialization pipeline

### Layer 3: Configuration
- YAML file-based configuration
- Environment variable override support
- Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- Safety flags (e.g., require_confirmation)

### Layer 4: Core Functionality
- Database drivers (Phase 3)
- Migration execution engine (Phase 4)
- Advanced commands (Phase 6)

---

## Configuration Structure

### Default Location
- `./janus.yaml` in current working directory
- Override with `--config <path>`

### Environment Selection
- Flag: `--env <name>` (default: "dev")
- Loads configuration from `environments.<name>` section

### Field Definitions
- `database_url` - Database connection string (supports env var substitution)
- `migrations_path` - Directory containing migration files
- `require_confirmation` - Safety flag for production databases

### Environment Variables
- Viper auto-loads environment variables
- Supports pattern: `MIGRATE_TOOL_*` for CLI-specific vars
- Can override any config field

---

## Development Rules

### Code Organization
- **cmd/** - Executable entry points
- **internal/** - Internal packages (not exported)
- **test files** - Inline with source (e.g., `root_test.go`)

### Build Process
1. Cross-platform compilation with CGO disabled
2. Version info injection via ldflags
3. Binary output to `bin/` directory
4. No dependencies on system-specific libraries

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests required for public functions
- Test naming: `Test<FunctionName>`
- Run tests with `make test`

### Error Handling
- All errors propagate to main
- Exit code 1 for any error
- Graceful shutdown on errors

---

## Phase 2: Documentation Hub & Branding (COMPLETED)

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Jekyll-based documentation site with minimal theme
- [x] Janus branding identity (logo, naming conventions)
- [x] Documentation landing page with navigation
- [x] Asset management for logo and graphics
- [x] GitHub Pages integration and deployment

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] Responsive Jekyll theme with minimal dependencies
- [x] Base URL configuration for `/migration-tool` subpath
- [x] Asset serving with relative_url filter compatibility
- [x] SEO-friendly metadata and page titles
- [x] Fast build times and zero external dependencies

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Documentation site builds without errors
- [x] Logo displays correctly on landing page
- [x] All documentation links resolve properly
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow triggers on doc changes
- [x] Site renders correctly with minimal theme
- [x] Assets served from correct paths with relative_url

### Deliverables
- docs/index.md - Main landing page with centered logo
- docs/_config.yml - Jekyll configuration with theme & baseurl
- docs/assets/logo/janus-roman-pillar.svg - Primary logo asset
- GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- Complete rebranding from "migrate-tool" to "Janus"

### Implementation Notes
- Changed all references from "migrate-tool" to "Janus" across documentation
- Logo centered using Jekyll relative_url filter for proper path handling in GitHub Pages
- Minimal theme provides clean, professional documentation appearance
- Assets directory structure prepared for future graphics and screenshots
